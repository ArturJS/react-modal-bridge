# react-modal-bridge
The bridge between lawless react-modal and strict opinionated modal API

The main purpose of this package is to create strict API around [react-modal](https://github.com/reactjs/react-modal) to use it in react based apps.

## Requirements

Make sure you have at least 16.8.0 version of react and react-dom.

Otherwise if your react version is ^15.3.0 you can upgrade it with help of [react-codemods](https://github.com/reactjs/react-codemod#rename-unsafe-lifecycles).
